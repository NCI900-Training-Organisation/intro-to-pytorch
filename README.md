  # Guide to Launch JupyterLab on ARE
 
This quick guide demonstrates the material and environment setup required for the workshop.
## Prerequisite
Project membership:  
 - [vp91](https://my.nci.org.au/mancini/project/vp91/join) *(Note: after the request is approved, the system takes around 20-30 mins update your account.)* 

## Step 1. Make User Directory
Create a username directory under /scratch/vp91:  

```bash
mkdir -p /scratch/vp91/$USER
```

This should be the place where you store all your training material.

## Step 2.  Clone GitHub Repo
The material and data for todayâ€™s session are available in our public GitHub repository, clone it to the folder above.   
```bash 
cd /scratch/vp91/$USER    
git clone https://github.com/NCI900-Training-Organisation/intro-to-pytorch
```   
    

## Step 3.  Prepare JypyterLab in ARE
At your browser go to [are.nci.org.au](https://are.nci.org.au/), login with your NCI account. At the interface go to **JupyterLab**.    
 
## Step 4.  Configure Job Settings
The parameters depend on the content of the workshop. Below are general use only **unless specified by your instructor**.   

**Queue**: `normal` *(Note: this is a free text field)*.
**Compute size**:  `small` 
or if you need GPUs
**Queue**: `gpuvolta` 
**Compute size**:  `1gpu` 

**Project**: `vp91`  
**Storage**: `scratch/vp91`     *(Note: No starting slash)*

## Step 5.  Configure Modules and Environments
Below are examples only. Please check the workshop resources for the correct settings.   

Click on the **Advanced options**   
  

**Modules**: `python3/3.11.0 cuda/12.3.2`   *(Note: One space only between modules)*   
**Python or Conda virtual environment base**: 
`/scratch/vp91/Training-Venv/pytorch`
